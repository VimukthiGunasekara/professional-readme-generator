## ⚙️ [Installation](#table-of-contents)
Use your terminal to clone or download or copy the zip file to a directory of your choice. Then open the file in VS Code or whatever editor you use. In VS Code, open the terminal and navigate to professional-readme-generator in the root directory. Now you can run the application!
     
## 💯 [Usage](#table-of-contents)
Launch the terminal by typing 'node index' after the installation is complete. After answering the prompts, you should see a console log showing your answers, a message that says ‘Successfully generate to README.md! ’, and you should see your file called ‘README.md’. Then you can use that code to your readme file.
